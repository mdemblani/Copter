# COPTER
Implementation of the classic Copter Game using the basic C++ graphics library.

## Working
The game works on the mouse click detection. When the mouse is pressed, the Copter flies up and when the mouse is left, the copter flies down. At the bottom, there is a score i.e the distance covered.

## Collision Detection
The collision detection alogorithm is simple, in a way that it considers the copter as a rectangular box and if the any part of the walls in the path, overlap with any part of the rectangular box, i.e if the x-y coordinates of the rectangular box and walls overlap, then it is counted as a collision/

## Screenshot
I don't have the original screenshot, but am providing the screenshot of the original game on which the project was implemented as a refrence for the how the game looks when the code is executed. The **Score** displayed on the bottom-left cornor is present, but the **Best** on the bottom-right cornor is not there in the current code.
